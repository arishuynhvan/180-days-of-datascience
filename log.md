# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6th January 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I decided to work on the Pomodoro Clock Project on FreeCodeCamp. The result was a simple design with HTML and CSS. I find the time limit imposed by this challenge really helpful as it stopped me from wasting my time with one single aspect of the project. I try to stick with the most agreeable result for now, but eager to explore more designs with CSS3. Will work with JS tomorrow - MUST postpone design till CSS is done!

**Thoughts:** It was really hard to just design a normal, basic look for the clock. I was using Material Design Colors for basic colors of the clock, but really spent long time choosing among options. In the end, I ended up with dark and light blue (again). For some weird reasons I still think that cold colors are easier to use than hot colors, so I really need to work more on my color theory and its application.

### Day 0: 7th January 2017 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Enhanced my blog with Disqus comments

**Thoughts**: It was kinda confusing rather than challenging due to the lack of such tutorials on the web. I documented my steps in the latest [blog post](https://arishuynhvan.github.io/100DaysOfCode-Day2/)
