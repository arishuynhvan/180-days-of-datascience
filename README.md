# I've joined the #180DaysOfCode Challenge.

* [Rules](rules.md)
* [Log - click here to see my progress](log.md)
* [FAQ](FAQ.md)
* [Resources](resources.md)

## If you've decided to join:
1. This challenge is an adaptation from the [66 mini hell formula by Mr. Thia Kai Xin](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-data-scientist-without-a-PhD/answer/Thia-Kai-Xin)
2. Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) daily. [Example](https://github.com/arishuynhvan/180-days-of-datascience/blob/master/log.md).
3. **Spend minimum 60 minutes every day on data science for the next 180 days.** (60 mins/day for 6 months)
4. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. **Tweet your progress every day using the #180DaysOfDataScience hashtag.**
7. Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
9. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
